### Accuracy

This is mostly a fun project by two programmers, therefore high accuracy is a non-goal.\
But we aim to make it compatible with most commercial games.

### TODO

- implement remaining BIOS calls (mainly sound functions)
- handle attempts to read BIOS memory in all BIOS calls
- test BIOS against more games / fix bugs
